        <div class="title">Origins of Korean Fried Chicken</div>
        <div class="body-text">Korean fried chicken, known as “chikin” in Korea, has a rich and fascinating history. Its
            roots can be traced back to the Korean War in the 1950s when American soldiers stationed in Korea introduced
            fried chicken to the local population. The dish quickly gained popularity due to its crispy texture and
            flavorful taste, leading to the establishment of the first fried chicken restaurants in South Korea in the
            1970s.</div>

        <div class="secondtitle">The Birth of a National Favourite</div>
        <div class="secondbody-text">In the 1970s, South Korea experienced rapid economic growth, and with it came an
            increased demand for fast food. Fried chicken, which was relatively easy and quick to prepare, became a
            popular choice among Koreans. Early Korean fried chicken was heavily influenced by American recipes but soon
            began to incorporate unique Korean flavors and techniques. One of the first major innovations was the
            double-frying method, which resulted in an extra-crispy exterior while keeping the meat juicy and tender.

        <div class="thirdbody-text">The 1980s and 1990s saw the emergence of numerous Korean fried chicken chains, each
            bringing their own spin to the dish. Major brands like Kyochon, Bonchon, and BBQ Chicken started to dominate
            the market. These chains introduced a variety of flavors and sauces, from sweet and spicy yangnyeom sauce to
            garlic soy and honey butter. The trend of serving fried chicken with pickled radish and beer, known as
            “chimaek” , also became popular during this period.

            Korean wave, or “Hallyu,” which includes K-pop, K-dramas, and Korean cuisine, played a significant role in
            promoting Korean culture worldwide. Korean fried chicken chains started to open branches in the United
            States, China, Japan, and Southeast Asia, introducing the world to this crispy delight.

        <div class="fivebody-text">As Korean fried chicken gained popularity globally, it underwent further adaptations
            to suit local tastes. In the United States, for example, flavors like buffalo sauce and ranch dressing were
            added to the menu. In Japan, a lighter, less spicy version became popular, while in Southeast Asia, local
            spices and herbs were incorporated into the recipes. Today, the love for Korean fried chicken has spread far
            and wide, reaching places like Abu Dhabi, where food enthusiasts enjoy this delectable dish. The
            introduction of Korean fried chicken in Abu Dhabi highlights the global appeal and adaptability of this
            beloved Korean culinary creation.
